# OpenSwitchMaps (Manifest v3)

Map service switcher as Chrome Extension 

This is a fork from ![tankaru/OpenSwitchMaps](https://github.com/tankaru/OpenSwitchMaps). Kudos for the great work!! Thanks!


## Motivation for fork (New Features & Fixes)

- Chrome Manifest v3
- Some cleanup done. Added new maps.
- Chanced the Categories, because some grew to big, while others remained small.
- Switched behavour in the Map Popup: Left Click now opens in new Tab, Middle Click opens in same Tab
- Sorted the Maps by Name
- Show Descriptions while MouseOver in Options Popup
- Existing Extension was listing the Categories in Columns. This limited the number of Categories. Also was a waste of space with smaller Categories. Solution: Render Categories in rows
- Some issues with v3 upgrade triggered removal of Firefox Browser Support, now Chrome only.
- For Performance/Usability Reasons, many map services where removed


## You are missing maps?

- Raise an [issue](https://github.com/limex/OpenSwitchMaps-v3/issues) in github. I might add it, if I like the map.
- But: I will DEFINITLY NOT add all the maps of the original Repo from tankaru.

## You still want that map added?

- Fork the code, [add it yourself](dev-howto.md).
- I didn't change the code segment, that lists the maps. It is easy to add your map, if you know Javascript. Or github copilot üòâ


## Install

you have 3 options ...

### a) from Chrome Marketplace

- [Chrome webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/openswitchmapslimexv3/ahkklpcjhdbcmfkikkifnaonfakmeiga)
- Opening the Dialogs on _first_ click take some seconds to show up. Be patient. :)


### b) Load unpacked dist directory from github

1. Download the /dist Directory from github (Clone the Code or Code -> Download ZIP) to a Directory of of your choice
1. Add to your Chrome/Firefox
   - Chrome: chrome://extensions/ -> Load unpacked
